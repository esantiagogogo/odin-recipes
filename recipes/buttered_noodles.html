    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
    <p>You may be wondering: "Do I really need a recipe for buttered noodles?" The answer, of course, is yes. This kid-friendly recipe results in perfect noodles tossed in exactly the right amount of butter. Once you try these four-ingredient buttered noodles, you'll never go back to your old method again.</p>
        <h2>General Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Noodles: This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Butter: You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</li>
            <li>Parmesan: Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper: Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
        </ul>
