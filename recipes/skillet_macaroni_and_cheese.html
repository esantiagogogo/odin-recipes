    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Ditch the boxed stuff with this easy to make mac and cheese. With just a handful of ingredients it can be ready faster than boxed macaroni.</p>
    <p>Macaroni and Cheese is often regarded as a comfort food for the not-well-to-do. While true, it's also a comfort food for just about anyone who thoroughly enjoys the texture of moist, squishy noodles and far too much cheese. You know who you are.</p>
        <h2>General Ingredients:</h2>
        <!-- Editorial note, the source recipe didn't have a "general ingredients" list, so I possibly might have embellished here -->
        <ul>
            <li>Noodles: Macaroni recipes call for "elbow" style noodles, but I suppose you could use any noodles you have on hand. Maybe hit up the grocery store real quick, and look for "hollow, semi-circle tubes", can't miss 'em.</li>
            <li>Cheese: Colby Cheese tends to be the go to for this dish, but you can experiment with other soft/metlable cheeses. More cheese = less sad. Want some spice? Use pepper jack. </li>
            <li>Cream: heavy cream will help with making the cheese more smooth and velvety. Remember that moist, squishiness earlier? This does all that. Maybe go easy on this.</li>
            <li>Evaporated milk: I don't know, it's mac and cheese, this seemingly helps the dish taste less like your sadness and more like creamy happiness. If that's your thing.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h2>Detailed Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces macaroni</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>                
            <li>1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 ounce heavy cream</li>
            <li>6 ounces grated Colby cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h2>Step by Step Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients (<em>and feelings</em>).</li>
            <!-- Editorial note, the source recipe didn't have a "mise-en-place" step, there are like 5 total ingredients, but it's important to remind the sad folks to gather their feelings and ingredients before starting to cook -->
            <li>Place a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in dry macaroni noodles. Pour in enough water to barely cover macaroni. Bring to a boil, stirring continuously. </li>
            <li>Continue stirring the macaroni until water is almost evaporated and pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Pour in evaporated milk and cream. Add grated cheese and stir until cheese has melted and everything is well combined. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
